My action towards these information existed without my consent:
As for my name: there are several people have the same name as me, so maybe they just put their
true name on. So to this aspect, I decide to let the owner remain the site.

But as for my username: it's not easy to make the nickname as mine. So if I find any information
related to me on his site, I will ask him to delete these information and even let him/her to shut
down the web site.

The other information has not been found during my research.
