# 📖EPITA AIMS Resources📖
Hello, mate!~ Welcome to my sharing! 😄🎉🎉

This is the database for materials during my study(2022.03-2023.08) at EPITA in major: Artificial Intelligence for Marketing Strategy.
This folder shares all the (the majority of) slides, works(in-class and off-class), final projects/evaluations and also courses arrangement for the each semester etc.. Please use these works just as references, don't copy it directly because it is bad for your study and also they are my personal **intellectual property**.

<li><b> There are 3 semesters in total(for 2022 AIMS spring intake there are four semesters).</b></li>

<li><b>If you have any question about the course, the materials or the codes, please contact me at the following email:</b></li>

📧<b>haozhe.tang@epita.fr</b>

<li> <b> There must have some mistakes, improvements or errors in codes, if you can improve them and send me with the improved ones, I'd really appreciate it! 💗</b> </li> <br/>

<b>Hope you can spend your study at EPITA smoothly.</b>
