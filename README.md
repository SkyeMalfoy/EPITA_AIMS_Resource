# EPITA_AIMS_Resource
This is the database for materials during my study(2022.03-2023.09) in EPITA in major:Artificial Intelligence for Marketing Strategy.
It includes slide(majority), works(in-class and off-class), final projects/evaluations and also timetable for the whole year etc. Please let these works just as an example, don't copy it directly because this is not good for your study.

<li><b> There are 3 semesters in total(for 2022 spring intake there are four semesters). Courses in both campus(EPITA, EM Normandie) are not as same as it shows on syllabus.</b></li>

<li><b>If you have any question about the course or the codes, please contact me at the following email:</b></li>

<b>skyetang0426@gmail.com</b>

<li> <b> There must have some mistakes or errors in codes, if you can improve them and send me with the improved ones, I'd really appreciate it!</b> </li>

<b>Hope you can spend your stady at EPITA smoothly.</b>

### All materials are updating gradually...
