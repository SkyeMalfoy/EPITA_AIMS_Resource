# Social Media Strategy

**It is a course with a really fast pace: please pay attention to the professor all along.** <br/>

In this course, the evaluation is splitted into two parts:
<li>At least five articles on a social media about your views of a certain marketing industry.</li> <br/>
<li>Final presentation of a real-world case study. (ATTENTION: the time is highly restricted)</li><br/>

**Final Score: 14.8**
